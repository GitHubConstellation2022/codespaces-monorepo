[Wikipedia](Wikipedia) says:

In version control systems, a monorepo […] is a software development strategy where code for many projects is stored in the same repository. As of 2017, various forms of this software engineering practice were over two decades old, but the general concept had only recently been named. Many attempts have been made to differentiate between monolithic applications and other, newer forms of monorepos.

At GitHub, we tend to think of a monorepo as having one or more of:

- large amounts of code
- multiple discrete projects
- lots of users
